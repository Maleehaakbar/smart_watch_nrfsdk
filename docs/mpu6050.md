1. The Sample Rate is generated by dividing the gyroscope output rate by SMPLRT_DIV:
Sample Rate = Gyroscope Output Rate / (1 + SMPLRT_DIV)

where Gyroscope Output Rate = 8kHz when the DLPF is disabled (DLPF_CFG = 0 or 7), and 1kHz
when the DLPF is enabled 

so if SMPLRT_DIV=0 , then sample rate = 8000 for gyro
to make it 100, SMPLRT_DIV = 79 , so 8000/1+79 = 100

2. FS_SEL selects the full scale range of the gyroscope 
0 ± 250 °/s
1 ± 500 °/s
2 ± 1000 °/s
3 ± 2000 °/s

so if 0 , FS_SEL = 250
