To include an exernal lib (fusion)
import as git submodule
include in cmakelist.txt file(not necessarily global/project cmake, include in the cmake where u need
i-e where your imu, sensor fusion code reside)  
dont need to create git submodule file, it creates when you run submodule command in terminal
